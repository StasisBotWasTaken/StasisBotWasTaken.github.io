Genome Project	WUG	rare	Enchantment	188	WUG	GWU	Whenever a creature you control enters, teach it flying if a creature you control has flying. The same is true for first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, trample, and vigilance. (To teach a keyword, put a counter of that kind on it. If it already has that keyword, put a +1/+1 counter on it instead.)			normal	CNY		Art Validated
